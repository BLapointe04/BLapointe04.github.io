            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>My problem statement is that students today have begun relying on AI to complete their homework, I recently overhear some students saying they have been using it since the beginning of school and dont plan on doing the work. Though I believe AI is a useful tool in assisting I belive that we should be using it for ONLY assisiting and not doing the work as we dont learn and develop as we should. I used an AI for homeork for a week and had fallen wayyy behind and after looking back and changing what I did It really helped not using the AI and learning for myself..</p>
